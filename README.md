# Program #3 - The Egg Sandwich Shop

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to create a program that allows the wait staff at The Egg Sandwich Shop to easily calculate a customer’s total bill with tax based on their menu selection.  The menu should include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Drinks:  Coffee, Tea, Hot Chocolate, Milk, Juice (customer can select multiple options)</li>
    <li>Eggs:  Scrambled, Over Easy, Sunny Side Up, Poached (customer can select ONLY one option)</li>
    <li>Extras:  Cheese, Bacon, Sausage, Ham, Veggies (customer can select multiple options)</li>
</ul>

<p>Drinks are $2.25, each egg order is $6.95 and any extras are $1.50 each.  Make sure to calculate the total bill, showing the sub-total, tax, and total with tax as separate line items. </p>
